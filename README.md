**You should download the middleware and it's dependencies in "middlewares" folder to use it.**
This middleware requires [geoip-lite](github.com/geoip-lite/node-geoip) and [express-ip](https://github.com/CITGuru/express-ip).
I don't sure about using this in  large scale applications. Because this middleware process all requests. Use things like cloudflare instead of this in large scale applications.
Happy don't be hacked!
